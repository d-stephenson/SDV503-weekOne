Week #One
Lab #One

Incredibly positive classes this week. It was fun applying some of the things I'd learnt over the holiday period in class session. 

I am close to finishing freeCodeCamp, see enclosed .PNG file for reference. However it was beginning to be challenging beyond my present 
ability so I intend to come back to the last few questions with greater understanding.

In addition reading 'Eloquent Javascript' has helped a lot in understanding some of the basic syntax, and it was useful having my understanding 
confirmed in class. 

In order to get 'ahead' of this class session, aware that there is a conflict, I had created a calculator following some online tutorials 
mainly to get the practice in, and becoming to become more familiar with the language, I have included that here under index.html. I also did 
some basic number sums which are commented out at the bottom of this file.

On index.js you will find the Lab as required and also a couple of the other challenges we did in class, including the one you tasked myself 
and Noel with, you will find we solved the riddle!

Until next week.
